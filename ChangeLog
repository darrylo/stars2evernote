	  This version is identical to version 0.85, except that the various
	  files have been edited to update their version number to 1.0.

	* Version 0.85 released.

	* Tags added by the user in google reader are now imported by default.

	* Adding of tags can now be suppressed with the --no-tags option.

	* The starred article blurb can be suppressed (not included) in
	  the translated .enex file using the --no-blurb option.  This
	  exists just in case there is some weird html in starred articles
	  that cause errors in Evernote when importing the .enex file.

	* Version 0.81 released

	  Synchronization works much better, but any starred note with a
	  <table> is likely unsynchronizable.  Unfortunately, there's no
	  easy way to fix this.

	* While notes could be imported into a notebook, notebook
	  synchronization was totally broken.  Much has been fixed, but there
	  is still more work to do.

	  In particular, Evernote requires that <table> height be specified,
	  but there's no easy way to fix this.  Any notes with tables without
	  explicit height specificatins will fail to synchronize.

	* The <audio ... >...</audio> element has been banned, because there's
	  no easy way of guaranteeing that the note usage meets Evernote's
	  ENML requirements.  All occurrences are now completely stripped out.

	* Initial version 0.80 released
